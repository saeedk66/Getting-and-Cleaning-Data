# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## Coursera project
For this project we using data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

This repository containts the following files:

* run_analysis.R the R script which used to get, clean, and run the required analysis for this project.
* CodeBook.md which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
* Tidydata.txt final data after going through everything required for this project.
* README.md explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

For this project we are required to Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. And From the data set in last step, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
